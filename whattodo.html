	<h1>What To Do</h1>
	<p>If you have read this information and have any reason to believe you are being stalked, or it sounds similar to what someone you know is experiencing, you are probably right. I don’t say this to alarm you, but to help label what you have been experiencing, so you can get the help you deserve. There are four recommendations that should be followed,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Collect evidence</li>
		<li>Zero Contact</li>
		<li>Inform Others</li>
		<li>Personal protection</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Collecting evidence includes things like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Screenshots of texts</li>
		<li>Call logs</li>
		<li>Packages you have received</li>
		<li>Anything you think is related to your case, no matter how small</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The unfortunate truth is that stalking is a crime that puts the burden of proof onto the victim. Many law enforcement agencies don't have the training required to be able to handle a case like stalking. The Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center (SPARC), has created an incident log you can use to organize all of your information.

	<p>Inform Others</p>
	<p>Go to your local police station, or call to have an officer meet you at your home and make your case. Many victim-survivors when faced with explaining their experience, minimize what happened, and are self-conscious, which leads to disbelief and indifference. It is on the victim-survivor to convey how this has taken over their life, how it has affected them, how it endangers them. Write up an impact statement about how this has affected you, to have with you when you meet with the officer. You are able to have documents with you when meeting with an officer, if you have your documentation you can show them how long it impacted and the severity. Additionally, it will be easier to explain to the officer what you felt if you write it ahead of time and have it with you.</p>
	<p>Similarly to reaching out to the police, reach out to your friends, family, neighbors. Not only do stalkers expand from their primary victim to include their victims friends, family, and neighbors, they can help support you. They can accompany you in public, be a witness to law enforcement, and help you so your world doesn’t get totally destroyed and overwhelmed by this crime.</p>
	
	<p>Personal Protection</p>
	<p>Research to find local victim advocacy organizations to help you when you reach out to law enforcement. A national victim advocay organization focused on stlaking victims is Stop Stalking Us, they offer a lot of resources, and the ability to get your experience heard.

	<p>Additionally, it is advised to go through your social media accounts and unfriend anyone you don’t know and think through future posts you make. Many people have been found from reflections in posts or small details that give away where they are. It may feel like a part of your freedom is taken away, being told to limit what you do but so many people have been hurt. I have no background to offer substantial advice, but please consider making these small changes that could save your life.</p>
