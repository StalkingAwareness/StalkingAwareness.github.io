<h1>Types of Stalkers</h1>
<p>Paul Mullen, a leading expert in stalker typologies, has created a categorization system for stalkers, they are by no means extensive. It should also be noted that an offender can fit in multiple categories or change between them over time. The five types of stalkers are, the rejected; the intimacy-seeking; the incompetent suitors; the resentful; and the predatory.</p>
<h2>The Resentful</h2>
<p>The rejected are usually ex-intimate partners pursuing their victim out of the hope for reconciliation, or rage at rejection, or a mixture of both.</p>
<h2>The Intimacy-Seeking</h2>
<p>Intimacy-seekers are driven by a one-sided, delusional, infatuation to assert a loving relationship with someone who has made clear their disinterest, or to complete strangers.</p>
<h2>The Incompetent Suitors</h2>
<p>The incompetent suitors in contrast to the intimacy-seekers, are pursuing the prospect of a date or some other contact, usually sexual. They are inept and self absorbed who press their unwanted, crude, attentions on those whom they find attractive.</p>
<h2>The Resentful</h2>
<p>The resentful puruse an individual, and occasionally an organization, to exact revenge for some actual or supposed injury or humiliation.</p>
<h2>The Predatory</h2>
<p>The predatory stalk preparatory to an attack, it is almost always sexual in nature.</p>
