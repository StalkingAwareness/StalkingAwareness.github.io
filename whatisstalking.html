<h1 style="text-align: center">What is Stalking?</h1>
<p>Stalking is a pattern of behavior that happens repeatedly over time. The tricky part of the  definition is “reasonable fear”. For example, Alexis works at a regular 9-5 office job, her coworker starts leaving bouquets for her. It might seem harmless, most people wouldn’t fear a bouquet of flowers at their work. But recently he started sending them to her home  even though she never told him her address. To Alexis, it’s a sign he knows where she will be, stalking is often made up of small events that don’t seem threatening to a reasonable person, but leave the victim living in fear, stress, and like they are being watched.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:60px">Types of Stalkers</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:40px">Paul Mullen, a leading expert in stalker typologies, has created a categorization system for stalkers. These categories are not exhaustive, and individuals may fit into multiple categories or change over time. The examples below are fictional and meant only to illustrate each type. You can find more information on Professor Mullen’s website here: <a href="https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopeneer; noreferrence">https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/</a></p>
<h3>The Resentful</h3>
<p>The rejected are often ex-partners pursuing their victim out of the hope for reconciliation, anger at rejection, or both. For example, Paul breaks up with his girlfriend Charlotte. Charlotte believes they should still be together and, over a period of three months, calls, texts, and shows up to Paul’s house repeatedly.</p>
<h3>The Intimacy-Seeking</h3>
<p>Intimacy-seekers are driven by a one-sided, infatuation to assert a loving relationship with someone who has made clear their disinterest, or to complete strangers. For instance, Jacob is obsessed with a classmate he has never talked to. However, he believes they are together and keeps trying to send gifts.</p>
<h3>The Incompetent Suitors</h3>
<p>The incompetent suitors in contrast to the intimacy-seekers, are pursuing the prospect of a date or some other contact, usually sexual. They are lonely and oblivious who press their unwanted attentions on those whom they find attractive. Tim meets Isabella and asks her out. She politely declines but Tim misinterprets her politeness as interest. He starts showing up to places she will be at and sends her notes and gifts, thinking he’s “winning her over,” much like romantic portrayals in media.</p>
<h3>The Resentful</h3>
<p>The resentful pursue an individual, and occasionally an organization, to exact revenge for some actual or supposed injury or humiliation. Karen was recently fired from her job, and believes coworkers in a different department set her up. She uses stalking as a tool to induce fear, justifying her actions as retaliation for what she believes they did.</p>
<h3>The Predatory</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:80px">The predatory stalk preparatory to an attack, it is almost always sexual in nature. Joe notices a new neighbor, Lauren who just moved in and starts watching her. He tracks her routine online and in person. Like resentful stalkers, predatory stalkers use stalking as a means to an end, they use it to observe before they attack.</p>
