<h1 style="text-align: center">What is Stalking?</h1>
<p>As stated on the home page, the legal definition of stalking is, <strong>"A pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear for their safety or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress."</strong> But what does that mean? The patern of behavior means behaviors that occurred more than onvce, that doesn't mean the specific behavior, if they contact you through text and then phone calls that counts. The tricky part of this definition is the reasonable fear part, below is a video from The Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center that can help to explain it. It is a video meant to educate law enforcement but it gives a clear example of why reasonable fear is different for each person. Lets use an example, I'm sure you have a fear, spiders, enclosed spaces, heights, or the spider lady from Coraline (seriously she is so creepy!). Would a reasonable person be afraid of a spider? Maybe yes maybe no but who decides who that is? If you've had bad experiences in the past with spiders, or are allergic, you will feel a lot more fear than someone who isn't affected by that. Stalking is about context, and relating everything to why, someone looking in won't feel the same as you.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:60px">Types of Stalkers</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:40px">Paul Mullen, a leading expert in stalker typologies, has created a categorization system for stalkers, they are by no means extensive. It should also be noted that an offender can fit in multiple categories or change between them over time. The five types of stalkers are, the rejected; the intimacy-seeking; the incompetent suitors; the resentful; and the predatory.</p>
<h3>The Resentful</h3>
<p>The rejected are usually ex-intimate partners pursuing their victim out of the hope for reconciliation, or rage at rejection, or a mixture of both.</p>
<h3>The Intimacy-Seeking</h3>
<p>Intimacy-seekers are driven by a one-sided, delusional, infatuation to assert a loving relationship with someone who has made clear their disinterest, or to complete strangers.</p>
<h3>The Incompetent Suitors</h3>
<p>The incompetent suitors in contrast to the intimacy-seekers, are pursuing the prospect of a date or some other contact, usually sexual. They are inept and self absorbed who press their unwanted, crude, attentions on those whom they find attractive.</p>
<h3>The Resentful</h3>
<p>The resentful pursue an individual, and occasionally an organization, to exact revenge for some actual or supposed injury or humiliation.</p>
<h3>The Predatory</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:80px">The predatory stalk preparatory to an attack, it is almost always sexual in nature.</p>
