<h1>Types of Stalkers</h1>

<h2>The Resentful</h2>
<p>The rejected are usually ex-intimate partners pursuing their victim out of the hope for reconciliation, or rage at rejection, or a mixture of both.</p>
<h2>The Intimacy-Seeking</h2>
<p>Intimacy-seekers are driven by a one-sided, delusional, infatuation to assert a loving relationship with someone who has made clear their disinterest, or to complete strangers.</p>
