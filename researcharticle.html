<h1 class="center-text"><strong>Stalking: The Invisible Crime In The Digital Age</strong></h1>
<p>Fear, anxiety, powerlessness, Nicole Madigan felt all of these and more when she saw her address posted online by her stalker. This was the breaking point, what started as a chance encounter with an ex-girlfriend of her future partner, led to Nicole having to pick up the pieces as best she could. Stalking is defined as “A pattern of behavior directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for the person’s safety or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress.”</p>
<p>Stalking laws have failed to keep up with the constant improvement and changes to technology, allowing stalkers to exploit gaps in the legal system, like weak enforcement, and lack of digital harassment definitions, leaving victims unprotected and without support. National estimates suggest that one in three women and one in six men are stalked at some point in their lifetime. Research done by the CDC, and The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, found that in the past twelve months, over 10.7 million people in the United States have been stalked in one form or another, only a third of those cases were ever reported, and less than two percent of stalking cases reported resulted in a conviction.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for confusion to occur when trying to define when stalking starts, was it the first interaction, the first message, the first time the victim felt fear? The vagueness of the term “cause a reasonable person to feel fear” does not accurately offer protections against stalkers who utilize seemingly harmless methods. Would a reasonable person feel fear when they are sent a bouquet of flowers, or receive the message “I liked your outfit”? Stalking is often referred to as the “invisible crime” because it is made up of small acts that on their own don’t convey the seriousness of the crime. It is made up of gifts being sent to their work, letters left at their door, and messages sent to their phone. The first interaction is usually harmless, and brushed off as a one time thing. Without recording the first interactions, a pattern of behavior gets harder and harder to build, leaving victim-survivors with less protection.</p>
<p>Opponents of increased anti-stalking laws argue that the increased overview will allow the misuse of stalking in cases where an individual was just giving their opinion and will impact the first amendment right to free speech. Broad definitions lead to harder enforcement and criminalize legitimate behaviors. The author of Stalking by law: Damaging victims and rewarding offenders, found this in their forensic mental practice when a client was convicted of stalking after sending only two text messages. Despite the receiver being upset over the messages and it qualifying as stalking under legal definitions it can not be put on the same level as someone who sends hundreds of messages over two years. Recently, there was even a Supreme Court ruling on a stalking case.</p>
<p>In 2023 the Supreme Court ruled on Counterman v. Colorado, a case from 2017 where Counterman was convicted of stalking in Colorado for sending hundreds of messages to an individual over a period of two years. Counterman appealed to the Supreme Court that the Colorado stalking law infringed on his right to free speech and that they did not prove he had intent behind his messages. The Supreme Court ruled that the State had to prove the defendant was reckless in their communication. This ruling shows that updated laws could impact free speech and impact well meaning individuals who want their opinions heard. However, the arguments for anti-stalking legislation have some similarities, they agree the definition is too broad and should be clarified. They also argue for better police training in handling stalking case,s and for better protections when technology is involved.</p>
<p>A study done by The Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center found that 80% of stalking cases involved technology. Additionally, a study from 2023 found a link between stalking behavior occurring online and a 12 percent decrease in the victim acknowledging it as stalking. Nicole Madigan had to face this when Karissa, an ex of Adam, her future partner, started to stalk her.</p>
<p>In 2017 Nicole was at a gathering for her son’s sports league and encountered her future stalker, Karissa. While Nicole was taking pictures of her son. Karissa’s first comment was innocuous: “Are you taking pictures of Adam?” Later that night, Nicole started getting messages from Karissa, it continued into a month later. Nicole was annoyed for the continuous messaging but there was nothing to fear yet. It eventually stopped, but after about a year from their first meeting, the contact resumed.</p>
<p>In 2018 Nicole and Adam started dating, they posted a few selfies from a party they hosted and later that night, Nicole started to receive vulgar messages from Karissa. She continued to contact Nicole throughout the next year, through text messages, burner phones, and posts on social media. Up to this point, Nicole had maintained the view that if they just ignored Karissa, she would eventually get bored. This is a common belief of victim-survivors, and is standard advice given by law enforcement “Come back later when it gets worse” being the standard response many victims get. Many victim-survivors were told by friends, family, even authority figures, they must have done something to cause it, just ignore it, that they were overreacting.</p>
<p>Societal fear and the stigma that has surrounded stalking has pushed victims not to come forward, to stay silent, the exact thing that the offender wants. It has created the reluctance to report and talk about non-violent stalking, victims are left feeling if there are no physical wounds there wasn’t enough impact to justify reporting it.  They want to take over their victims life, the stalker wants power, the stalker wants control. Eventually, Nicole and Adam realized Karissa would never leave them alone if they didn’t involve the police.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nicole faced the next major barrier, law enforcement. When explaining her case to the police officer, Nicole felt self-doubt, something many victims feel, since from the outside, her story sounded like two women fighting over a man, with no laws being broken. When only one or two instances are focused on they aren’t easily attributed to a crime, they can be as unassuming as a bouquet of flowers delivered to their house that sends them into a panic. When it is looked at as unconnected events they are often ignored and with amusement. Nicole's experience reflected this, the officer treated it with amusement and to contact the police when it gets concerning.</p>
<p>Karissa used many different forms of technology to reach Nicole, from countless social media accounts, burner phones, and possibly trackers, these only scratch the surface of what is possible. Police officers do not have the required training when it comes to cases like stalking, which are ongoing and made up of tiny occurrences that by themselves may not be illegal, but when everything is added up it’s overwhelming. Long term societal views have shaped how stalking is perceived, and they have impacted how the police view the crime. It has become an invisible crime, a crime ignored by law enforcement allows the offender to continue, often escalating.</p>
<p>Karissa continued to escalate, reaching a climax when she made posts insinuating she had moved into Nicole’s neighborhood and sent a package to her door. She knew her address, and even posted Nicole’s upcoming wedding venue and date. Eventually, Nicole was able to file a report and get in contact with a police officer that understood the severity, she gave all of the evidence she had recorded over the past three years and her statement. The only thing she could do now was wait.</p>
<p>Technology and the internet have become tools that offenders can manipulate. There are countless services that let you find a person's phone number, home address, and services that offer full anonymity to send whatever you want to their house. It would not be a lie to say society has developed a dependency on technology. It simplifies complex tasks, provides directions, orders food, locates lost items, allows global communication, and that is only on your phone. Students are dependent on it to access assignments, workplaces use it to contact their employees, in this day, you are almost required to have a phone just to be able to function in the world. So what happens when that technology is used against you?</p>
<p>The Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center has put stalking into four common forms, Life invasion, Interference, Intimidation, and Surveillance, technology heavily impacts all of them. Life invasion includes phone calls and messaging, and leaves the victim with a sense of no control, it takes over their life, stealing their sense of freedom. Interference impacts the victims life, messing with their financial situation, sabotaging their work, and upending their life. Intimidation is threats, confrontations, insults that degrade the victim, all things that are easily done from any device. Surveillance covers actions like using tracking software and GPS devices, obtaining info about the victim provided by data brokers across countless websites, and proxy stalking, where the stalker uses other people to contact and harass the victim.</p>
<p>Researchers found that tile trackers, Bluetooth trackers you attach to your items, are able to be hacked and allow stalkers to see the location. Even if an individual is not smart enough to be able to hack tile trackers, GPS tracking devices are so small that it can be easily slipped into someones bag, purse, or even their car. A research study found that more than 40 percent of stalking victims were tracked by a Bluetooth location device. An average model can be as cheap as 10 to 50 dollars, besides GPS trackers being relatively cheap, other devices like listening devices, and tiny cameras, can be ordered with the click of a button, even being advertised as “spy devices”. It does not stop at physical items that are used for surveillance and to track victims, one of the most detrimental items used is information.</p>
<p>The internet is a Pandora’s box of information that is easily accessed, information that enables these crimes. In Nicole's situation, the information was not used to physically harm her, but in many cases it ends a lot differently. Recently, on June 14 2025, Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, were shot and assassinated. Additionally, Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman were shot, by the same offender, fortunately they lived. It was found that the offender had thoroughly planned and stalked his victims, and had a notebook with nearly 70 names and 11 mainstream search platforms for finding people’s home addresses and other personal information, like phone numbers and relatives.</p>
<p>Because this information was readily available, two people died and two more were injured. It is just one more tool available to stalkers to find their victims address, phone number, and family, to attack, and destroy, their lives. This information is collected without the consent of the individuals and sold, accessible by stalkers, accessible to commit murder.</p>
<p>Eight months after Nicole submitted her report to the police, two years and ten months after the first abusive message, she received the news that Karissa was charged with stalking. Many other victim-survivors are not as fortunate as Nicole, they do not have the familial support, their stalkers do not stop at psychological harm, and they do not get a definitive end. The laws do not do enough to prevent stalking online, leaving victims to fight and protect themselves on their own. Information is taken, sold, and made available to anyone willing to pay, Reforms to anti-stalking laws need to be created, where the punishment fits the significant impact that was placed on the victim. The lack of training and lack of support reinforces the behavior and attitudes towards the crime, if there are not consequences and roadblocks stalkers will not stop, lives will continue to be destroyed and dominated by their stalkers presence. Technology growth is not stagnant, and will only grow, if the laws and protections do not keep pace to protect people online, their lives will be upended. Nicole Madigan says it best “They are destroying lives and it needs to stop.”</p>
