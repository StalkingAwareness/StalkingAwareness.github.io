<h1 style="text-align:center">Impacts on Victim-Survivors</h1>
<p>There is not enough space and time to be able to clearly explain all of the impacts victim-survivors of stalking have to face. The portrayal of stalking in media has not only done a diservice it has made it something to be jealous of, something to joke and laugh about. This is a crime that can not only extend beyond years, but lead to physical, sexual, and even fatal violence. The impacts are wide ranging from impacting mental, physical, and social health, to impacting financially, and at their job or school. It includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Denial</li>
	<li>Confusion</li>
	<li>Self-doubt</li>
	<li>Self-blame</li>
	<li>Depression</li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Insecurity</li>
	<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
	<li>Fluctuations in weight</li>
	<li>Dizziness</li>
	<li>Unable to focus at work, school, or in social settings</li>
	<li>Withdrawal from friends, family, and events</li>
	<li>Costs incurred for self protection and legal costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these are only a few of a much longer list, a more complete list can be found here: <a href="https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/victim-support/impact-of-stalking-on-victims"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/victim-support/impact-of-stalking-on-victims</a></p>
