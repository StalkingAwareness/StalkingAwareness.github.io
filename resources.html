<h2>Victim Advocacy</h2>
<p>The Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center "helps the helpers", they work to make sure that the victim service providers, campuses, law enforcement agencies, and other places, get the training and resources on how to help and support stalking victims. While they do not directly interact with victims, they have a lot of great resources, like the Stalking Log, and information resources.
